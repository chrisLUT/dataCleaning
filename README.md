# Coursera Assignment - Data cleaning with R

In this Repo the script run_analysis.R contains all code I used. It contains a lot of commentary to explain what the code does to the viewer.

As I'm learning about the *data.table* package at the moment, I used some of its functionality for this assignment.

I'm doing step 4 before step 2, because I identify the variables to be extracted in step 2 by their variable label I get from step 4.

In Step 2 ("Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement"), I interpreted the instructions that per feature one mean and one sd should be retrieved. I did not include other variables containing the string 'mean'
like the 'meanFreq()' variables (as specifified in features.txt in the project's zip-file).

The codebook.md describes briefly the variables - should be sufficient for this exercise.

The tidy data set in the end is in long format - as either long or wide form is acceptable for this assignment.
